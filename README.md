# Module_4_Challenge
This is the repository for my module 4 challenge. In this module challenge, we analyzed the performance, volatility, risk and risk-return for four funds and the S&P 500, and then diversified our portfolio. We ran calculations on the data and then graphed our results. In the end I chose Tiger Global management as the best portfolio.
